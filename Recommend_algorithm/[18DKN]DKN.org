*** background description
- the method for building news recommendation system.
- CF is not suitable(DMF)

*** challenge description
- time-sensitive
- topic-sensitive in news reading(*knowledge*)
- news language is usually highly condensed and comprised of a large amount of knowledge entities and common sense(*knowledge*)

*** preliminaries
- knowledge graph embedding
  - TransE,...,TransD
- CNN for sentence representation learning
  - Kim CNN: word embedding, one dimension CNN, max Pooling to a vector

*** problem formulation
- input: all news clicked by a user, and current candidate news
- output: the probility of the user clicking the current candidate news

*** constructure
- DKN framework
  - knowledge distillation from a knowledge graph
    - entity linking
    - sub-graph
    - entity embeddings
    - context embeddings
  - KCNN(knowledge-aware CNN)
    - embedding input
